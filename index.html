                <h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>
                <p>
                    We, the hosts, are currently working on honing our respective crafts and would like our environment to enable us in our pursuits rather than distract us with irrelevances. However, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a place in Montreal where we could all keep our finger on the pulse of what’s going on in the spaces we’re interested in? Moreover, wouldn’t it be better if we could be a part of that pulse? Now is the time to manifest both of these things. 

                <p>
                We're creating a hub for young inventors, artists, engineers, and scientists to meet, talk, and build together. A place where people come to share their ideas and current projects, hopes and ambitions, dreams and struggles, quests and journeys that they are in the process of executing.

            <div id="work-section">
                <h1>Ideology</h1>
                <p>
                Frankly, we don't care where you're from or what you look like so long as your life philosophy is positive and life-affirming. A positive worldview, or gestalt (gestalt: the structured whole of the way in which you perceive things), finds meaning and beauty in life and instinctively believes in free will (whether or not you intellectually define free will to be something that you think has any bearing on reality (however you chose to define that) is irrelevant, what matters is that you feel like you have some degree of power over, or inter-being with your environment). It is positive in the sense that it generates ideas and solutions to problems rather than merely identifying problems. A negative gestalt, such as cynicism or nihilism, is one that denies the agent of her agency thus taking the world in bad faith (mauvaise foi); it generally aims to put the world down. It is negative in the sense that it does not offer any vision of its own, defining itself as the negation of other ideologies or manners of being. 

                <p>
                <em>
                If you are proactive and optimistic, if you like building and learning, you're welcome here.
                </em>

We're interested in computers, math, discrete math, partial differential equations, analysis of algorithms, benchmarking things, books, physics, neurotech, science, art, digital art, history, tech companies, anthropology, building things, electronics of all kinds, bits, programming, programming languages, computer architecture, economics of chips and chip-making (processors not fries), solving partial differential equations on chips, imaging the sky, imaging the early universe (thats my job), imaging the brain, adaptive optics, Fourier transforms, fast Fourier transforms, how come bicycles stay upright again?, the energy sector, geopolitics, sport, Miyazaki, among other things. If you like thinking about any of those things or are particularly nerdy about your own thing, please come and visit!
