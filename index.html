            tHIS IS A RECRUITING MESSAGE FOR A GROUP-HOUSE IN mONTREAL, STARTING mARCH 2024. <br/><br/>

            Hi. I'm Steve. I'm a person with some degree of inner turmoil. I value kindness, originality, and candid, unironic zeal. Fabio is my friend from teenage-hood; we played music together back in the day. Now he makes software. I am working in radio interferometers. I play with FPGAs, but I'm still a novice at that. We grew up in Brussels and are now living in Montreal. <br/><br/>

We're starting a house together and are in search for kindered spirits with whom to share a common living space. If you would like to move to Montreal in March and identify with any or all of the following:<br/>
- You're self starter<br/>
- You like to hack, build things, and create art in any of its forms<br/><br/>



I (Steve) endorse: Raw HTML, Empress Wu Zetian, Georges Brassens, Staying up all night because you had an amazing idea and you need to get it down, Strange diets because they tend to corrolate with originality (e.g. vegan, or only eating egg-yolks, caffein pills, soylint and like eight esoteric suppliments within a two-hour window each day), Feeling tormented by the little voice in your head, Being competitive on the edges, Philosophical or religious conviction and a personal relationship with the divine (Atheism is also endorsed), Conviction in general as there appears to be a lack of it; but scepticism is also definitely endorsed, A positive vision and ideas for how to implement them, Romantic notions of love, Mystery.<br/><br/> 

My favourite time of day is sunrise. <br/><br/>

I don't endorse: Intolerance, Mallice, Unwillingness to engage in thoughtful conversation, Thinking that the end of the world is approaching.<br/><br/>


Cumulatively (\cup) we speak English, Francais, Italiano, ein bisschen Deutch, Espanol, 一点点中文. The languages we have in common (\cap) are English and Francais (und sehr bisschen Deutch). <br/><br/>


Please get in touch if you're interested. You can call me directly (and possibly save us the trouble of having to schedule a call), or text me or email me. <br/><br/>
