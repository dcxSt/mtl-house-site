      tHIS IS A RECRUITING MESSAGE FOR A GROUP-HOUSE IN mONTREAL, STARTING mARCH 2024. <br /><br />
      <hr>
      <p class="steve">Hi. I'm Steve. I'm a person with some degree of inner turmoil. I value kindness, originality, and
        candid, unironic zeal. Fabio is my friend from teenage-hood; we played music together back in the day. Now he
        makes software. I am working in radio interferometers. I play with FPGAs, but I'm still a novice at that. We
        grew up in Brussels and are now living in Montreal. </p>

      <p class="fabio">Hey, I'm <a href="https://fabiobarbero.eu/">Fabio</a>! I'm excited to come to Montreal for an
        internship at an AI Startup. Nerdying out
        on computers is one of my passions, but nowadays I try to spend more time moving my body (running, yoga,
        cardio,...) and playing and learning new musical instruments. I do enjoy contemporary Jazz, and have been
        playing the piano for many years. </p>

      <hr>
      <p class="steve">We're starting a house together and are in search for kindered spirits with whom to share a
        common living space. <span class="fabio">If you would like to move to Montreal in March and identify with any or
          all of the following:</span><br />
        - You're self starter<br />
        - You like to hack, build things, and create art in any of its forms<br />
        - <span class="fabio">You like to be active and explore</span>
      </p>


      <hr>
      <p class="steve">I (Steve) endorse: Raw HTML, Empress Wu Zetian, Georges Brassens, Staying up all night because
        you had an amazing idea and you need to get it down, Strange diets because they tend to corrolate with
        originality (e.g. only eating egg-yolks, caffein pills, soylint and like eight esoteric suppliments
        within a two-hour window each day), Feeling tormented by the little voice in your head, Being competitive on the
        edges, Philosophical or religious conviction and a personal relationship with the divine (Atheism is also
        endorsed), Conviction about anything in general as there appears to be a lack of it; but scepticism is also definitely
        endorsed, A positive vision and ideas for how to implement them, Romantic notions of love, Mystery.<br /><br />

        My favourite time of day is sunrise. <br /><br />

        I don't endorse: Intolerance, Mallice, Unwillingness to engage in thoughtful conversation, Thinking that the end
        of the world is approaching.</p>
      <p class="fabio">I (Fabio) endorse strange diets too, ideally as close to vegan as possible. I also endorse doing
        things that question the "why" of the status quo, not taking things too seriously, sobriety, getting
        enthusiastic about
        things and projects, wanting to share creativity, healthy expressions of anger (and any other feeling often
        repressed).<br /><br />
        I do not endorse philosophies and thoughts that discard other ideas on the basis that they're "just wrong",
        passive-aggressiveness, unwillingness to learn new things.</p>
